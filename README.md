RTBank
======

This anti-theft app for Android poses as a banking program. A 'stolen' state can be activated(by changed file, contact, app etc.) and send information(GPS, audio, picture, etc.) from the stolen device to another device(by text, e-mail, phone etc.). Presently, only a preference screen can be configured.
